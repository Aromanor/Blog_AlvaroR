# **Transferencia de aprendizaje y fine-tuning**.

## **Introduction**

**Transfer learning** consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem. For instance, features from a model that has learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify skunks.

Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch.

The most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the following workflow:

1.  Take layers from a previously trained model.

2.  Freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during future training rounds.

3.  Add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers. They will learn to turn the old features into predictions on a new dataset.

4.  Train the new layers on your dataset.

A last, optional step, is **fine-tuning**, which consists of unfreezing the entire model you obtained above (or part of it), and re-training it on the new data with a very low learning rate. This can potentially achieve meaningful improvements, by incrementally adapting the pretrained features to the new data.

First, we will go over the Keras `trainable` API in detail, which underlies most transfer learning and fine-tuning workflows.

Then, we’ll demonstrate the typical workflow by taking a model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, and retraining it on the Kaggle “cats vs dogs” classification dataset.
